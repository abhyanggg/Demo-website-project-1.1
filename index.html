        <h1>🌍 Earth: Mind-Blowing Facts</h1>
        <p>Unreal sounding facts about our planet — but 100% real.</p>
    </header>

    <section class="facts-section">

        <div class="fact-card">
            <h2>1. Earth is Smooth as a Cue Ball</h2>
            <p>If you shrunk Earth down to the size of a billiard ball, it would be smoother than an actual cue ball — despite mountains, trenches, and oceans.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fact-card">
            <h2>2. We Are Floating on Molten Rock</h2>
            <p>The ground you stand on is just a thin layer (less than 1% of Earth's radius) floating on a massive ocean of molten magma constantly moving beneath us.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fact-card">
            <h2>3. Earth Is Traveling 107,000 km/h Through Space</h2>
            <p>Right now you're moving through space at insane speed — but you feel nothing because everything around you is moving at the same speed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fact-card">
            <h2>4. The Deepest Point Is Deeper Than Most Airplanes Fly</h2>
            <p>The Mariana Trench is so deep (11 km) that if you dropped Mount Everest inside, its peak would still be underwater.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fact-card">
            <h2>5. Earth Glows with Light You Cannot See</h2>
            <p>Earth constantly emits infrared radiation and an invisible glow caused by interactions in the atmosphere — it's literally shining all the time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fact-card">
            <h2>6. The Core Is as Hot as the Sun</h2>
            <p>Earth’s inner core reaches temperatures of about 5,700°C — similar to the surface of the Sun.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fact-card">
            <h2>7. Earth Is Mostly Water — but We Can’t Use 97% of It</h2>
            <p>Only 3% of Earth's water is freshwater, and most of that is locked in ice — meaning less than 1% is available for humans.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fact-card">
            <h2>8. One Day Was Only 6 Hours Long</h2>
            <p>Billions of years ago, Earth spun so fast that a full day lasted just 6 hours. The Moon’s gravity has been slowing Earth down.</p>
        </div>
